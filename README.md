Im going on vacation to Hawaii and decided to do some climate analysis in order to be prepared for the weather during my long overdue vacation. 

The data was found using an SQLite database and with that database I gathered some of the following information: 
  
  Using SQLAlchemy to reflect existing databases in Python
  Plotting queries with a Pandas DataFrame to analyze the precipitation levels over the past year. 
  Plotting a histogram to summarize the data from the most active stations over the past year. 
  Retrieving JSON data such as values, statistics, and other observations by creating a Flask API.
